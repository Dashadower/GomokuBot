Python bot to play Gomoku using minimax, AlphaBeta search


Hello. This is my attempt to create a not so stupid Gomoku AI in python. Originally, I had to do this for a high school fair, and I made it
in a rush.

Currently, there is an implementation of single process AB search, multiprocesses AB search, and a very stupid MCTS. I recommend checking out
AlphaBeta.py and AlphaBetaMultiProcess.py
